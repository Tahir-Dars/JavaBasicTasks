# JavaTasks
This repository contains basic tasks and a few pure OOP tasks. The code for these tasks is solely made by me. The code includes comments explaining the details. It is comprehensive. The files have undergone multiple reviews by me, but if you find any mistakes, please pardon them and consider it as part of yourÂ assignment.
